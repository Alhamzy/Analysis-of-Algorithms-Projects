# Analysis-of-Algorithms-Projects
Projects completed under the supervision of Dr William Hendrix. For the course Analysis of Algorithms COT 4400 at University of South Florida.

# Topics Covered
- Time complexity
- Sorting Algorithms in C++
- Dynamic Programming

# Project Desciption
## Project 1
- Compare the different time complexities between different sorting algorithms
- Analyse how performance varies based on sorted, constant and randomly sorted array inputs
- Algorithms Compared: Selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort and quick sort


## Project 2
- Manipulate 2D vector to find the easist way to close the gaps between two sets of teeth (top and bottom)
